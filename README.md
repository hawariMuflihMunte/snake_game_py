# snake_game_py

This is a simple terminal-based Snake game implemented in Python.

<br>

## Usage

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Install the `windows-curses` package by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```
This package provides a Windows-compatible version of the curses library, which is required for the game to work properly.

2. Run the game by executing the main.py file:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

- Control the snake using the keys (W, A, S, D).
- The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible and avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.

Note: This game is specifically designed for Windows systems. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to install a different version of the curses library to run the game successfully.

Have fun playing the Snake game! üêç
